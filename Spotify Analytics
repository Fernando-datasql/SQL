# For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.
# Afterwards, I inserted the Spotify data into a table I created.
# Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 

#Creating the table: 


CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL 
)

#Next I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.

#Then, I explored the data using the following SQL. 

-- Who are the 10 most popular artists in the data?

SELECT artist_name, popularity FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity desc 
limit 10;

--What is the the avg popularity, danceability, and energy by artist and track?

SELECT artist_name ,track_name ,avg(popularity) ,avg(danceability) ,avg(energy)
FROM BIT_DB.spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name, track_name;

--According to the data, which song has the longest duration in seconds and who is the artist?

SELECT track_name, artist_name, MAX(duration_ms/1000)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata;

--According to the data, which song has the shortest duration in seconds and who is the artist?

SELECT track_name, artist_name, MIN(duration_ms/1000)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata;
